        Hello there! I’m Derek Peng. I’m a high school student who loves travelling, eating food, playing sports, and
        above
        all, being with friends. I enjoy creating [posters, photography, and more] and playing board games and video
        games.
        I like discovering new music, so drop me any song recommendations!
