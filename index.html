    <p>Bonjour, I’m Sophia! <em>And I’m Derek!</em> We’re glad you found your way here. High school is a roller coaster
        of a time, and we figured we should share the thrill. Here, you’ll find blog posts about life, editorials over
        current events, reviews over anything you can imagine, and whatever is left in between. Oh, and of course,
        <b>crisp</b> photos meticulously edited (no slapping on filters here). Feel free to correspond with us and learn more
        about our lives <a href="/about">here</a>. Enjoy. A bientôt!
    </p>
