    <p>Bonjour, I’m Sophia! <em>And I’m Derek!</em> We’re glad you found your way here. High school is a roller coaster of a time, and we figured we should share the thrill. Here, you’ll find blog posts about life, editorials over current events, reviews over anything you can imagine, and whatever is left in between. Oh, and of course, *crisp* photos meticulously edited (no slapping on filters). Feel free to correspond with us and learn more about our lives <a href="/about">here</a>. A bientôt!
        </p>
