There’s something wonderful about walking with Eddie in the rain. The world of worries and troubles melts away; life is reduced to a simpler state.

The water weighs down my hair, washing away my self-consciousness along with the pomade-paste hastily applied to my hair. My socks are soaked and my shirt clings to my skin. It’s impossible to look good in the rain, so there is no need to try. Lights are distorted through the water droplets on my glasses. Ordinarily, I’d have rinsed them off, sprayed them with cleaner, and wiped them to transparency, but not in the rain—there’s no use. My impotence is comforting.

Eddie’s skinny self darts around from flower to signpost to unknown-organic-material and back to flower again. I wonder what she smells in each sniff, if each scent is different or the same, which scents catch her nose… Eddie reignites a curiosity in me that has been hiding since childhood, from the days of asking “Why?” Nowadays, it’s “who cares” or “why does it matter” or “it makes no difference.” It takes too much time and energy to find out “why,” and in the end it doesn’t seem to matter. But it matters in the rain with Eddie. I wish she’d talk to me and tell me about her findings, but she just keeps on sniffing.

The rain smells wonderful as it hits the leaves and bounces off the pavement. It’s fresh yet timeless, as if it comes with tidings from another eon. I suppose it does, thanks to the water cycle. Normally, I don’t like getting wet—I’m not the kind of person who walks through sprinklers or under fountains. But in the rain, I don’t worry about getting wet. It’s inevitable. It feels good having to worry about one less thing, and now that I think about it, the rain feels good, too.

With Eddie, my only concern is getting her to walk in a new direction. She seems to love a certain route, probably because that’s where her parents take her. I think it’s good for Eddie to traverse new roads. I don’t want her to become set in her ways. I say to her, “Think about all the smells you’ve been missing!” Fighting Eddie’s preferred path is a peaceful respite from the pushes to study more and perform better that I get from my parents and from myself. It’s so easy to get carried away with test results and golf scores, to lose track of what gives my life meaning. Meanwhile, Eddie continues to pull me towards the right, sniffing all the while. Eddie doesn’t care about test results and golf scores.

The consistent pitter patter of the rain drops provides a pleasant contrast to the cacophony of life. As much as I love alternative and indie, it gets tiring listening to Lorde through my speakers for too long, not to mention the real people in my life. The rain doesn’t ask for my words, and I don’t give it any (besides for the occasional “Come on, Eddie!”). It’s nice no longer having to think about the right thing to say. It’s remarkable how tiring putting words together can be.

Eddie and I finish our loop and I return Eddie to her home. The heavy grey clouds linger, darkening as the evening progresses. Wetting the seat, I hop in my car and drive back into the real world accompanied by the bittersweet melody of “Ribs.”
