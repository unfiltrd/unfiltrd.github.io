For me, school during COVID felt almost in vain, as if we were half-heartedly going through the motions. It felt like graduation was coming a year too soon. It felt like I missed my best chance to make friends and memories with my fellow classmates. As the first semester wrapped up, I made a list of everything horrible about pandemic schooling. It was a satire of our issues and a commemoration of our trials. Its rapid-fire, unpolished, and unabashed criticisms mirror the exasperation and indifference that I felt at the time. It speaks for students around the world who put on a happy face every video call, and it speaks for those who didn't.
